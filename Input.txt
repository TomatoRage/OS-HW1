There is once was a saying I used to say 
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I win gold I would go through the roof 
He said what if u went platinum 
I just laughed at him
That is not happening 
That I cannot Fathom 
80 something million records world wide later
I am living in a house with fucking elevator
Summa summa dumma lumma 
U assuming I am a human 
What I got to do to get it through to you that I am superhuman
Innovative I made of rubber so that anything u say ricocheting off of me and stick to you
